<p> Thanks to our passion for innovation and our constant commitment to researching new learning pathways, we are able to offer a one-of-a-kind educational experience. </p>

# THE PROJECT

The project proposed by Start2Impact for the PHP and MySQL module is to create a platform that brings together subjects and courses that Owly wants to experiment with and offer to children.

The UN objective that is satisfied in this case is number 4, i.e. the one relating to the quality of education.

As written in the previous lines, the module focuses on the scripting language PHP, born way back in 1995, coupled with MySQL, a relational database management system, whose year of origin dates back to 2000.

# THE REQUIREMENTS

In order to create a good project, there are very specific requirements:

<ul>
<li> The use of RESTful JSON APIs, which respect the REST architecture, with a focus on naming, methods and response status codes. </li>
<li> APIs that allow the insertion, modification and cancellation of a subject that will only have the name as its characteristic. </li>
<li> APIs that allow the insertion, modification and cancellation of a course which will have as its characteristics the name, the subjects present and the number of places available. </li>
<li> Display of the list of courses, with the possibility of filtering them by name, subjects and places. </li>
<li> Using MySQL as a database. </li>
</ul>

# THE FRAMEWORK

To create the Owly platform, in all its aspects and functions, the open source framework Laravel, created in 2011 by Taylor Otwell, was used.

Among the main features we find:

<ul>
<li> The use of the Blade template engine, which allows you to write clean and dynamic code. </li>
<li> The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which ensures the separation of the presentation and business logic layers. </li>
<li> The Eloquent framework, which allows you to build queries to send to the database directly in PHP. </li>
<li> The presence of an integrated security system against hacker attacks, such as the CSRF token and others. </li>
</ul>
